# **World Palm Oil Data**
### *Project by Thea Francis*
<br/>

## Introduction

Palm oil has the lowest production cost among the major oils. Thus, palm has become the most used oil crop around the world. about 40% of all vegtable oils. The demand and production of palm oil has been increasing each year, it is projected to be 240Mt in 2050.

hat's because palm oil is cheap. The plant that makes it, the African oil palm, can produce up to 10 times more oil per hectare than soybeans.
But as my new book on palm oil's history shows, this controversial commodity hasn't always been cheap. It became that way thanks to"

This project aim to show the data of palm oil production around the world from 1998 to 2020:

 1. 
 2. 
 3. 
 
By using data from several CSV files, the project plots the increasing levels of oil production among different countries.


**Spreadsheets** 
The `data` folder contains the CSVs uploaded from website (https://).

### Running the Program
1. Python 3 is required. This project is written using version 3.10.1.
2. Clone the repo from github.
3. Setup a virtual environment and activate it.
4. To make sure you have all the necessary packages, run "pip install -r requirements.txt". The following packages will be required to run the program: 
        pandas, 
        numby, 
        matplotlib.pyplot 
5. The program can be run directly by running "main.py".



## Project Requirements

The following requirements have been met with this project:
Category 1:
   Read in data from a local csv, excel or other file type.
Category 2:
    Use built-in pandas or numpy functions
Category 3:
    Write custom functions to operate on your data.
Category 4:
