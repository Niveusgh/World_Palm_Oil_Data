### *Project by Thea Francis*
<br/>

## Introduction

Palm oil has the lowest production cost among the major oils. Thus, palm has become the most used oil crop around the world. about 40% of all vegtable oils. The demand and production of palm oil has been increasing each year, it is projected to be 240Mt in 2050.

This project aim to show the data of palm oil production around the world from 1998 to 2020:

 1. 
 2. 
 3. 
 
By using data from several CSV files, the project plots the increasing levels of oil production among different countries.
