# **World Palm Oil Data**
### *Project by Thea Francis*
<br/>

## Introduction

Palm oil is extracted from the the African oil palm. It has the lowest production cost among all the major oils. It has become the most used oil crop around the world for about 40% of all vegtable oils. The demand and production of palm oil has been drasticity increasing each year. The production is projected to reach 240Mt in 2050.


This project aim to show the data of palm oil production around the world from 1960 to 2018:

 1. The top 10 palm oil production country
 2. The major palm production country
 3. Global deforastation trend over the years
 4. The trend of gloal palm oil production through the world
 
 

## Source
All data are from ourworldindata.org .


### Running the Program
1. Python 3 is required. This project is written using version 3.10.1.
2. Clone the repo from github.
3. Setup a virtual environment and activate it.
4. To make sure you have all the necessary packages, run
```
 "pip install -r requirements.txt". 
 ```
 The following packages will be required to run the program: 
- pandas, 
- numby, 
- matplotlib.pyplot, 
- scipy,
- seaborn </br>

To run the "Jupyter.ipynb" file, Jupyter Notebook needs to be installed. </br>

5. The program can be run directly by running "main.py" from the script folder. You can also run the "Jupyter.ipynb" file from script folder using Jupyter Notebook.


## Project Requirements

The following requirements have been met with this project:
1. Read in data from a local csv, excel or other file type.
2. Use built-in pandas or numpy functions
3. Write custom functions to operate on your data.
4. Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.
5. Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your reasons.


## Data Analysis Conclusions
Indonedia and Malaysia are the biggest contributors. Combined, they produce 87% of global palm oil. And the deforestation data showin that the tropical forest in Indonesia has been declining over the past 3 decades.
